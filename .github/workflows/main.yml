# 2. When a pull request is created or updated that targets the 'main' branch.

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code
      # This action downloads source code onto the runner.
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      # Using a specific version ensures consistency.
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # It's good practice to upgrade pip first, then install from requirements.txt.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      # Step 4: Lint with flake8
      # A fast check for Python syntax errors and style issues before running tests.
      # This command checks the main app file and the entire sharkbite_engine directory.
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          pip install flake8
          # Stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
          # Exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
          flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

      # Step 5: Run the full test suite with pytest
      # Pytest will automatically discover and run all files named test_*.py in the 'tests' directory.
      # The tests will run headlessly without needing a browser!
